I love that moment when it makes sense; that is, when the analysis
uncovers patterns and relationships from amongst the noise and piles
of data files. As a data scientist that worked in marine physics and
astrophysics, I have amassed substantial experience in wrangling,
analyzing, visualizing, and interpreting data. How can I help your
organization bring meaning to your data to solve business challenges?

I've been analyzing astrophysical and oceanographic data for 20 years,
and I am training at BrainStation to work as a data scientist. A
science background is good but it doesn't get you far without knowing
the modern data stack!

In my most recent job at RBR Ltd, an ambitious oceanographic
instrumentation company, I transitioned from a siloed university
researcher to a more collaborative task-oriented worker. I learned how
to adapt to short lead times, to rapid project scope changes, and to
balancing multiple projects. I mastered Matlab, and was a daily user
of Atlassian’s productivity software (Bitbucket, Jira and
Confluence). I was the “Team Lead” of a small group of scientists
within the R&D department, and I was responsible for aligning our
projects with the company’s strategic objectives. My projects required
close collaboration with divisions outside of R&D: I collaborated with
engineering, sales and marketing, software, and service.
