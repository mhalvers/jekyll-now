title:  NYC bicycle crash statistics and predictive modelling
---

######  ######

The goal is to build a predictive model for bike crashes. In doing so,
we will discover the circumstances under which crashes occur, and even
what causes their severity.

For analysis code please visit my [NYC bike crash analysis
repo](https://github.com/mhalvers/nyc_bike_crash_analysis) on GitHub.
