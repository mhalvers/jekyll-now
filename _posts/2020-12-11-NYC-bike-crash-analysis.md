title:  NYC bicycle crash statistics and predictive modelling
author: Mark Halverson

## Summary

The idea with this project is to explore the predictably of bicycle
crashes in urban environments. Bike commuting is rising in popularity
in many major cities across North America, however saftey remains a
concern with many would-be cyclists.

The basic idea here is to study if the outcome of a bike crash is
predictable.  In this particular project, outcome means injury.  Of
course fatal outcomes are very important, but from statistical
standpoint they are difficult to predict from historical events
because they are very rare.

The circumstances we have to predict the outcome of a crash are mostly
dictated by the data available, which are probably not a comprensive
list.  Indeed, the modelling indicates that the outcome can not be
predicted with perfect accuracy, indicating that there are variables
missing from the model.

In constructing a predictive model, we will build a general
understanding of the circumstances under which crashes occur, and
perhaps even what causes their severity.
